# Presentation

Hi there! My name is Rodrigo and you can call me Rod :slightly_smiling_face:. I'm a software engineer with a special passion for solving complex problems.
I enjoy working in environments where teams own the full life-cycle of their projects (requirements collection, design, implementation, deployment, operation).
I have experience building resilient [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and [event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) applications.

My mathematical background has played an important role on my career as it has helped me face and solve complex problems with a data-oriented mindset.

I'm a friendly and informal person and over the years I've made a lot of friends at work, this is probably the main reason why work
has always been pleasant to me.

* Cloud native products/solutions
