Hi there! I'm a software engineer passioned for solving complex problems and a strong believer on team-work.
I enjoy owning the full life-cycle of the products I help building and I
have experience building resilient [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and [event-driven applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture).

I have a mathematical background and it has played a big role on my career as it has helped me in solving complex problems and to have a general data-oriented mindset.

I'm a friendly and informal person and over the years I've made a lot of friends at work, this is probably the main reason why work
has always been pleasant to me.
